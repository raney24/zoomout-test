    <h1>Integration</h1>
    <p>This past Labor Day I was at the beach with my now-wife (then-fiance) and 4 other married couples. The crowd was larger than normal and frustrations were showing within our group of 10 amateur surfers. Catching a wave is hard enough for me, but riding one and dodging people is nearly impossible. This became frustrating as the day went on, and it was difficult to hold back a yelling match with a random stranger wading into my line. 

As I was coming in from the day, I saw a younger group of strangers around our umbrella, and some of the ladies were beautiful and showing off more skin than I had asked for. At that moment, I had a choice to turn my eyes away and act like they didn’t exist or to indulge in the view I had. With my stress high and being on vacation, I chose to indulge. 

If you don’t know my story, I have struggled with sexual integrity for the larger part of my life (link to “my story” post). I was losing this battle until I confessed to my peers, family and fiance, sought help with a counselor, and joined support groups. This was a battle I faced every day. Even though by this point in my journey, the battle had gotten easier, this temptation on the beach was hard to ignore.

All of the books I read had told me to look away and train my eyes not to notice or lust at beauty, or to repress, which is the inhibition of seeing beauty. Repression operates under the assumption that we can cut these visuals out of our life forever which isn’t realistic.  However, my counselor, Patrick Holley, introduced me to a concept to combat lusting I had never heard of: Integration. It is not indulging in the beauty we see in people, nor is it the idea of ignoring the beauty that God has given us. 

Patrick explains this phenomenally, “With indulgence, we are treating the object as an end in itself, which is idolatry… Repression is the deliberate suffocation of a desire which is intended to awaken us to God… ” 

Integration, on the other hand, is the practice of receiving, giving, and letting go. “These three correlate with the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love,” Patrick states.

If we can agree that everyone is a child of God and that beautiful lady at the grocery store is a sister in Christ, then how can we turn our eyes away and ignore her? Instead, we can receive her beauty as a temporary gift from God. By no means am I saying to undress her in your mind, but if you can channel the beauty that she has and accept it as a gift from God, you will no longer be feeding your sexual desire.

Integration can be applied to anything. My wife has struggled with anxiety. She's been able to apply the same principles of receiving, giving and then letting go to anxious thoughts and feelings.

That night after our surfing session, Kayla, my wife, said to me, “Knowing the pain you go through with tempting visuals like those girls, it makes me want to hate them for wearing swimsuits like that.” I appreciate her passion and desire for my well-being, but she was quickly reminded that they are people and children of Christ, and that hating them was not the answer. Some unknown circumstances have made them who they are and made them decide to wear what they wore. We are just called to receive them with God’s intentions, give love to them like Jesus, and let go of any sexual desires we may have towards them. 

“Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness, how deep that darkness is!” Matthew 6:22-23 NLT
